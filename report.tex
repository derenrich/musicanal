\begin{abstract}
Automatic music classification is a poorly defined, yet important problem. While it is difficult to say what exactly makes a certain genre of music unique, identifying genres gives you a distinct advantage in recommending songs. In this paper, we use data from the Million Song dataset provided by The Echo Nest. We extracted a subset of the features provided, and ran KNN on the data after performing widening.

\section{}
So far we have downloaded and processed the dataset, choosing features that don't rely on any song metadata. This took the dataset from about 500 GB to 1GB, which will allow us to hold all of the data in RAM, which will be convenient during implementation. We've performed widening on our data
