\begin{abstract}
Automatic music classification is a poorly defined, yet important problem. While it is difficult to say what exactly makes a certain genre of music unique, identifying genres gives you a distinct advantage in recommending songs. In this paper, we use data from the Million Song dataset provided by The Echo Nest. We extracted a subset of the features provided, and ran KNN on the data after performing widening.
